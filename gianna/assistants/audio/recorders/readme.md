# Recorders

The `get_recorder` function is a utility function that simplifies the process of creating an `AudioRecorder` instance.
It takes a filename as input and returns an `AudioRecorder` instance configured with the appropriate audio recorder
based on the file type.

Here's how you can use the `get_recorder` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from assistants.audio.recorders.factory_method import get_recorder

# Specify the path to the audio file you want to record
audio_file = "path/to/your/audio/file.mp3"

# Get the AudioRecorder instance
audio_recorder = get_recorder(audio_file)

# Start the audio recording
audio_recorder.start()

# Perform any necessary actions while recording
# ...

# Stop the audio recording
audio_recorder.stop()
```

Explanation:

1. Import the `get_recorder` function from the `assistants.audio.recorders.utils` module.

2. Specify the path to the audio file you want to record. In this example, it is assumed to be "
   path/to/your/audio/file.mp3".

3. Call the `get_recorder` function by passing the `audio_file` path as an argument. The function will internally create
   an instance of the `AudioRecorderFactory`, use it to create an appropriate audio recorder based on the file type, and
   then create an `AudioRecorder` instance with the created recorder.

4. The `get_recorder` function returns the `AudioRecorder` instance, which you can assign to a variable (
   e.g., `audio_recorder`).

5. Use the `audio_recorder` instance to start the audio recording by calling the `start` method.

6. Perform any necessary actions while the recording is in progress, such as capturing audio input or processing the
   audio data.

7. Stop the audio recording by calling the `stop` method on the `audio_recorder` instance.

The `get_recorder` function simplifies the process of creating an `AudioRecorder` instance by encapsulating the creation
of the `AudioRecorderFactory` and the audio recorder. It provides a convenient way to obtain an `AudioRecorder` instance
with the appropriate audio recorder based on the file type.

By using the `get_recorder` function, you can easily create and use audio recorders without explicitly creating
instances of the `AudioRecorderFactory` and `AudioRecorder` classes.

> **Note:** Make sure you have the necessary dependencies and configurations set up for the specific audio recorder
> classes you are using.
