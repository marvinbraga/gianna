# Text To Speech

The code you provided is a function that utilizes the `TextToSpeechFactory` and `TextToSpeechType` from the `assistants.audio.tts.factories` module to convert text to speech. Here's an explanation of the code:

```python
from assistants.audio.tts.factories import TextToSpeechFactory, TextToSpeechType


def text_to_speech(text: str, speech_type: str, lang='en', voice='default'):
    speech_type = TextToSpeechType(speech_type)
    factory = TextToSpeechFactory()
    tts = factory.create_text_to_speech(speech_type, language=lang, voice=voice)
    tts.synthesize(text)
```

Let's break it down:

1. The function `text_to_speech` takes the following parameters:
   - `text`: The text to be converted to speech (of type `str`).
   - `speech_type`: The type of text-to-speech engine to use (of type `str`).
   - `lang`: The language code for the speech synthesis (default is 'en' for English).
   - `voice`: The voice to be used for the speech synthesis (default is 'default').

2. Inside the function:
   - The `speech_type` parameter is converted to a `TextToSpeechType` enum value using `TextToSpeechType(speech_type)`. This ensures that the provided `speech_type` is a valid value defined in the `TextToSpeechType` enum.
   - An instance of `TextToSpeechFactory` is created using `factory = TextToSpeechFactory()`. This factory will be used to create the appropriate text-to-speech instance based on the `speech_type`.
   - The `create_text_to_speech` method of the factory is called with the `speech_type`, `language`, and `voice` arguments to create an instance of the corresponding text-to-speech class. The created instance is assigned to the variable `tts`.
   - Finally, the `synthesize` method of the `tts` instance is called with the `text` parameter to convert the text to speech.

To use this function, you would need to provide the necessary arguments:
- `text`: The text you want to convert to speech.
- `speech_type`: The type of text-to-speech engine to use (e.g., 'google', 'whisper', 'eleven_labs'). Make sure the provided value matches one of the values defined in the `TextToSpeechType` enum.
- `lang` (optional): The language code for the speech synthesis (default is 'en' for English).
- `voice` (optional): The voice to be used for the speech synthesis (default is 'default').

For example:

```python
text = "Hello, how are you?"
speech_type = "google"
lang = "en"
voice = "default"

text_to_speech(text, speech_type, lang, voice)
```

This code will convert the text "Hello, how are you?" to speech using the Google Text-to-Speech engine with the default English voice.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies and configurations set up for the text-to-speech engines you want to use (e.g., Google Text-to-Speech API credentials, Whisper API key, ElevenLabs API key).

The `text_to_speech` function provides a convenient way to convert text to speech using different text-to-speech engines by leveraging the `TextToSpeechFactory` and `TextToSpeechType` from the `assistants.audio.tts.factories` module.
